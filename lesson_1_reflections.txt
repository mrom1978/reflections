How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
one of the versions was a working version so comparing both versions allowed to pinpoint where the bug existed. 
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It will allow me to correct the mistake made in the currect version by comparing to past version that did not have the mistake.
