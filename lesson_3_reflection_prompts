When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When work requires individual input in group work that later needs to be updated globally in locally. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?
GitHub can be public repository where many individuals work on a group project so manually pull change the commit that needs to be shared with other members of the group.
